## 📖 About The Project

**CryptoTrack** is a modern, futuristic cryptocurrency dashboard developed as the **5th Task** for my internship at **Future Intern**.

The goal was to build a fully functional React application that consumes a public API to track real-time crypto market data. I took the challenge further by implementing a premium **Glassmorphism UI** with a custom-built 3D animated background to demonstrate advanced CSS mastery alongside React logic.
